This is an analysis of women's education rates in Pinellas, Pasco, and Hillsborough Counties. 
These are all neighbouring counties in Florida, with their notable cities being St. Petersburg, 
New Port Richey, and Tampa, respectively. This will begin with analysis of the rates and age ranges of
women's education rates within the state. Then I will move into more complex stastical analysis with 
linear progression to (hopefully) predict the chances of an assigned woman being born in a particular 
county and the rates that they might get each type of degree.

**working on my understanding of applications of linear regression. that's the main point of this.**
